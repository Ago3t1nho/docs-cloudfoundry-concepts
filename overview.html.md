## What is Cloud Foundry?

Cloud Foundry is an open platform as a service, providing a choice of clouds, developer frameworks and application services. Cloud Foundry makes it faster and easier to build, test, deploy and scale applications. It is an [open source project](https://github.com/cloudfoundry) and is available through a variety of private cloud distributions and public cloud instances.

Cloud Foundry takes an open approach to Platform as a Service. Most PaaS offerings restrict developer choices of frameworks, application services and deployment clouds. The open and extensible nature of Cloud Foundry means developers will not be locked into a single framework, single set of application services or a single cloud.
