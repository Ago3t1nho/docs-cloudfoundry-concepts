title: Architecture
---

Cloud Foundry components include a self-service application execution engine, an
automation engine for application deployment and lifecycle management, and a
scriptable command line interface (CLI), as well as integration with development
tools to ease deployment processes.
Cloud Foundry has an open architecture that includes a buildpack mechanism for
adding frameworks, an application services interface, and a cloud provider
interface.

Refer to the descriptions below for more information about Cloud Foundry
components.
Some descriptions include links to more detailed documentation.

## Router

The [router](./router.html) routes incoming traffic to the appropriate
component, usually the Cloud Controller or a running application on a DEA node.

## Authentication

The OAuth2 server (the [UAA](./uaa.html)) and Login Server work together to
provide identity management.

## Cloud Controller

The [Cloud Controller](./cloud-controller.html) is responsible for managing the
lifecycle of applications.
When a developer pushes an application to Cloud Foundry, she is targeting the
Cloud Controller.
The Cloud Controller then stores the raw application bits, creates a record to
track the application metadata, and directs a DEA node to stage and run the
application.
The Cloud Controller also maintains records of organizations, spaces, services,
service instances, user roles, and more.

## Health Manager

[Health Manager](./health-manager.html) monitors applications, reconciles the
current state (e.g. running, stopped, crashed) and expected state, and directs
Cloud Controller to correct state mismatches.

## Application Execution (DEA)

The [Droplet Execution Agent](./execution-agent.html) manages application
instances, tracks started instances, and broadcasts state messages.

Application instances live inside [Warden](./warden.html) containers.
Containerization ensures that application instances run in isolation, get their
fair share of resources, and are protected from noisy neighbors.

## Blob Store

The blob store holds:

* Application code
* Buildpacks
* Droplets

## Service Brokers

Applications typically depend on [services](./services/) such as databases or
third-party SaaS providers.
When a developer provisions and binds a service to an application, the service
broker for that service is responsible for providing the service instance.

## Message Bus

Cloud Foundry uses [NATS](./messaging-nats.html), a lightweight
publish-subscribe and distributed queueing messaging system, for internal
communication between components.

## Logging and Statistics

The metrics collector gather metrics from the components.
Operators can use this information to monitor an instance of Cloud Foundry.

The application log aggregator streams application logs to developers.
