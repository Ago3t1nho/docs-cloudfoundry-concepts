title: Cloud Foundry Concepts
---

Deploying, running, and scaling applications for the web requires a complex infrastructure that can present a barrier to entry for application providers. The Platform as a Service model (PaaS) simplifies web application delivery by providing that infrastructure as a service.

The Cloud Foundry PaaS is a complete runtime environment that offers a choice of clouds, frameworks, and application services. Use Cloud Foundry to deliver, update, and scale applications.

This guide presents an overview of how Cloud Foundry works, a discussion of key concepts, and a glossary of terms. Refer to this guide to learn more about Cloud Foundry fundamentals.
